## 🧬 Introduction

This is a bioinformatic pipeline utilising the capabilities of nanopore sequencing ([ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/)) to combine multiple biomarkers of different sources; specifically, mutations, methylation and tumour immune infiltrate. This can enable prediction of drug compatibility in cancer tumours. This pipeline was developed as a clinical bioinformatic workflow that requires little bioinformatic expertise to use. The results of such a tool, with the appropriate pre-clinical trial, can be integrated as part of a protocol aimed to assist molecular pathologists and clinicians to swiftly develop personalised treatment plans.  

Panorama is built using the Nextflow workflow language and is intended to be used in the [EPI2ME](https://github.com/epi2me-labs) framework from [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](https://community.nanoporetech.com).

Panorama is intended for use as follows:  

### Stage One: In a Pre-Clinical Trial for a defined disease and single* treatment option 📋

   1. Biomarkers are input via a csv file, as detailed in the section [Biomarker panel input](#-biomarker-panel-input) below. This will form the basis of the bed file used for adaptive sampling, and is also used for downstream pipeline processes. Biomarkers can include SNVs, methylation markers, and certain immune infiltrate markers as determined by immune deconvolution using methylation markers.
   2. Tumour samples are nanopore sequenced using adaptive sampling and a bed file containing the target regions required for biomarker analysis. This bed file is produced by this pipeline with the flag `--make_target_bed` and the biomarker csv file using the input parameter `--panel_metadata`. Resulting bam files are used as input to Panorama. Bam files must be basecalled using modified base calling (5mC+5hmC contexts), and aligned to the hg38 genome.
   3. Using the flag `--clin_trial_mode` the pipeline will output sample data as a csv file corresponding to the input biomarkers.
   4. Following patient sequence data collection, the researchers will carry out their own classifier development using the biomarker results identified by this pipeline. This is outside this tool's scope and presumably will involve some kind of machine learning. Results are added to the original biomarker input csv file and used as input for clinical reporting.

**Multiple treatment options will be available in a future update*

### Stage Two: Patient sample reporting following a successful clinical trial 💊

   1. Using the results of the pre-clinical trial described above, and the final version of the biomarker input with classifier results, a single patient sample can be submitted to this pipeline as before, and will output a report based on the clinical trial results.  
   2. The pipeline can be run for a clinical sample using the flag `--clinical_mode`.

Please note that Stage Two has not been fully tested as there has been no such clinical trial carried out yet. This is expected to be finalised during/after an actual clinical trial. Please get in contact with the developers if you decide to use this tool in a clinical trial and we will assist/collaborate with trial design and clinical reporting development.
<!-- eg read depth requirements -->

## 🖥️ Compute requirements

Recommended requirements:

- CPUs = 32
- Memory = 128GB

Minimum requirements:

- CPUs = 16
- Memory = 32GB

*Based off [wf-human-variation](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation) as this is the most computationally heavy component of the workflow.*

## 🥳 Third-party requirements

This program uses MethylCIBERSORT and CIBERSORTx for immune infiltrate deconvolution. CIBERSORTx is provided as a Docker container by the developers, the Alizadeh and Newman labs at <https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/>. You will need to create an account and obtain the Docker token through the "Downloads" page. You do not need to install the Docker container, as it has been provided as an Apptainer build called `cibersort_fractions.sif` (see section [Containers](#containers)). You only need to provide your CIBERSORTx username (email) and token to Panorama for it to run. Please note it will take a few days for the CIBERSORTx developers to process your access request.  
Please follow all requirements required by the CIBERSORTx developers as stated when you register. Use of Panorama does not override the CIBERSORTx rules and requirements.  

Please get in contact with us if you are interested in using an alternative immune deconvolution package.  

## 🏁 Install and run

<!-- TODO: Integrate with EPI2ME -->
<!-- You can also access the workflow via the
[EPI2ME Desktop application](https://labs.epi2me.io/downloads/). -->

The workflow uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and software resources, therefore Nextflow will need to be installed before attempting to run the workflow.

The workflow can be run using [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html), [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (the open-source fork of Singularity, common on newer HPC systems). Please note it has not been tested using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
<!-- This is controlled by the
[`-profile`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles)
parameter as exemplified below. -->

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.
<!-- More information on running EPI2ME workflows can be found on the [EPI2ME website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex). -->

Once nextflow is installed, the following command can be used to obtain the workflow. This will pull the repository in to the assets folder of Nextflow and provide a list of all parameters available for the workflow as well as an example command:

```sh
nextflow run Genomic-and-Epigenomic-Research-Lab-NZ/wf-panorama --help
```

or

```sh
nextflow run http://github.com/Genomic-and-Epigenomic-Research-Lab-NZ/wf-panorama
```

To update a workflow to the latest version on the command line use
the following command:

```sh
nextflow pull Genomic-and-Epigenomic-Research-Lab-NZ/wf-panorama
```

<!-- A demo dataset is provided for testing of the workflow.
It can be downloaded and unpacked using the following commands:
```
wget https://ont-exd-int-s3-euwst1-epi2me-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/wf-template/wf-template-demo.tar.gz
tar -xzvf wf-template-demo.tar.gz
```
The workflow can then be run with the downloaded demo data using: -->

### Additional install requirements
<!-- TODO: update figshare.com link to actual url once it's confirmed -->

#### Containers

The container components of this tool are very large. These are hosted on [figshare.com](figshare.com):  
<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.32165103>  
You will need to download these containers separately in order to use this tool.  
On the plus side, you shouldn't need to download or set up any other packages!

Containers:  

- general.sif (0.4 GB)
- methylcibersort.sif (1.8 GB)
- cibersortx_fractions.sif (0.3 GB)  

Place these in the directory: `wf-panorama/containers/`  

#### Human Genome Reference

You will need to obtain your preferred human genome and associated index file and put it in the `wf-panorama/resources/` directory.  
During development the genome build `GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna` was used. Any genome build of hg38 should work, though other builds have not been tested.  

> [!TIP]
> You should be able to use a symlink (aka symbolic link, alias, shortcut) to avoid having multiple copies of the human genome scattered around your system. To add a symlink:  
>
> ```sh
> ln -s /path/to/<genome.fna> /path/to/wf-panorama/resources/.
> ln -s /path/to/<genome.fna.fai> /path/to/wf-panorama/resources/.
> ```
>
> Please note symlinks haven't been tested in this workflow yet. If there are mysterious errors try copying the genome to this location instead. Please let us know if you use symlinking wth the workflow and it works!

> [!WARNING]
> Methylation sites have been annotated by their Illumina array probe names, and mapped to hg38 genome locations. Unless you rebuild all the files in this workflow that use genome locations, using the T2T genome build will NOT work for the immune infiltrate section and/or will give wrong results!

To generate the genome index file using samtools (recommended):  

```sh
cd wf-panorama/resources
ref="GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna"  # or your reference file
samtools faidx ${ref}
# this creates a file called "GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.fai"
```

The index file is required to be pre-built. Ensure that this file is in the `resources` directory.

#### Chromosome size file

A chrom_sizes file is also required. While there is one included in the resources directory, it should be replaced by a fresh file created from the above index file like so:  

```sh
fai="/path/to/<genome.fna.fai>"
cd wf-panorama/resources
cut -f1,2 ${fai} > hg38_no_alt.chrom_sizes
```

This is then passed to the pipeline using the following parameter:  

```sh
--chrom_sizes_file hg38_no_alt.chrom_sizes
```

Ensure that this file is in the `resources` directory. If it is not specified, the pipeline will default to looking for `hg38_no_alt.chrom_sizes` in the `resources` directory.

### Run command

The workflow can be run using:
<!-- TODO: check profile options (epi2me uses "standard") -->
```sh
nextflow run Genomic-and-Epigenomic-Research-Lab-NZ/wf-panorama \
    --clin_trial_mode \
    --project_name Project_Name \
    --sample Test1 \
    --bam_directory /path/to/passed_bams \
    --panel_metadata /path/to/demo_input/panel_metadata.csv \
    --target_bedfile /path/to/demo_input/targets.bed \
    --mCS_cancer_type bladder \
    --cibersortx_username <email> \
    --cibersortx_token <token> \
    -profile slurm,singularity \
    -resume
```

For further information about running a workflow on
the command line see <https://labs.epi2me.io/wfquickstart/>

> [!Tip]
> If you are new to command line:  
> Install Nextflow (<https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/#get-started>). Once you have done that, come back here. Note that if you are on a cluster compute you may already have nextflow installed and just need to load it with something like `module load nextflow`.
> "Change directory" (`cd`) to a directory (another name for "folder") where you want to do your analysis.  
>
> ```sh
> cd /home/<your user name>/projects/run_panorama
> ```
>
> This will conduct the analysis inside this directory.
>
> ```sh
> nextflow run Genomic-and-Epigenomic-Research-Lab-NZ/wf-panorama --help
> ```
>
> Note that nextflow will keep things in `/home/<your user name>/.nextflow`

#### Nextflow Profiles

Profiles are selected with the `-profile` flag on the command line. Combine an **executor** profile with a **container** profile using a comma (e.g. `-profile slurm,singularity`).

| Executor profile | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| *(none / standard)* | Local execution with Docker |
| `local` | Explicit local execution, no container required |
| `slurm` | SLURM HPC cluster |
| `lsf` | LSF HPC cluster |
| `pbs` | PBS/Torque HPC cluster |
| `test` | Local execution with minimal parameters for install verification |

| Container profile | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| *(none / standard)* | Docker |
| `singularity` | Singularity (traditional HPC) |
| `apptainer` | Apptainer (newer HPC systems, open-source Singularity fork) |
| `conda` | Conda (limited support — not all processes are conda-compatible) |

> [!TIP]
> On HPC systems, use `--singularity_cache /path/to/shared/cache` to point to a shared container cache directory and avoid re-downloading containers for each user.

> [!WARNING]
> At this stage, the workflow has only been tested on a slurm HPC cluster using Apptainer. While Nextflow should allow the pipeline to be transferable, there may be some issues with other compute setups, and with using Docker.

Resource limits can be adjusted with `--max_memory`, `--max_cpus`, and `--max_time` to match your system's available resources.

## 🎈 Usage

There are three modes of operation, selected by the following flags:  

1. `--make_target_bed` - This uses the input biomarker panel to create a bed file with buffer regions, suitable for MinKNOW adaptive sampling. This is different to ONT's "Bed Bugs" tool as it adds the necessary regions for immune infiltrate calculation specific to this tool. You are welcome to double check the output with ONT's tool, accessible [here](https://epi2me.nanoporetech.com/bed-bugs/)
2. `--clin_trial_mode` - This runs sequence data processing, using input bam files, for a single sample. It generates a csv file of biomarker results in relation to the input biomarker panel, and can be used for machine learning classifier training with the goal of predicting response to treatment.
3. `--clinical_mode` - This runs sequence data processing using input bam files and a classifier, presumably generated during the above clinical trial. The input biomarker panel must contain all targets the classifier needs, and these must be captured by adaptive sampling.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A biomarker metadata csv file is required for all three modes of operation. See section [Biomarker panel input](#-biomarker-panel-input) for details.

### General Input Parameters

### General Output Parameters

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| project_outdir | string | Project-level output directory (primarily for `make_target_bed`). | Can be overridden manually, but using the default layout is recommended. | `<project_name>` |
| sample_outdir | string | Sample-level output directory for `clin_trial_mode` and `clinical_mode`. | Can be overridden manually, but using the default layout is recommended. | `<project_outdir>/<sample>` |

### Mode `make_target_bed`

This mode has two outputs, for use in MinKNOW adaptive sampling. You must use this mode to generate your adaptive sampling bed file, as it combines your specific targets with regions identified for immune deconvolution by methylation. If your bed file does not contain these regions then the tool will not be able to perform immune deconvolution.  
This mode may need to be rerun multiple times in order to create an optimal bed file that covers all regions adequately while also covering a suitable percentage of the genome. It will check if the resulting bed file meets all the requirements by using the `min_genome_coverage`, `max_genome_coverage` and `buffersize_bp` parameters. If the initial check fails, (it will tell you on the terminal) and/or you want different thresholds for these parameters, adjust them as desired and re-run until you get a successful message.  
For single site targets such as SNPs, buffer regions for adaptive sampling will be added appropriately. For targets that are larger regions, such as an entire gene, this mode adds 2000bp upstream and 1000bp downstream as the adaptive sampling "target region" and THEN adds standard buffer regions on top of these surrounding regions.
Please note that the MethylCIBERSORT reference data it uses to build the bed file is based on hg38 genome coordinates.  

#### Input

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| chrom_sizes_file | string | The path to a chrom_sizes file, generated from the index of the reference genome. | Optional. If not provided, the bundled `resources/hg38_no_alt.chrom_sizes` file is used. It is strongly recommended to generate this from the same reference genome you are using for sequencing — see [Chromosome size file](#chromosome-size-file). | `resources/hg38_no_alt.chrom_sizes` (bundled) |  

*Example run command*  

```sh
nextflow run Genomic-and-Epigenomic-Research-Lab-NZ/wf-panorama \
    --make_target_bed \
    --project_name Project_Name \
    --panel_metadata /path/to/demo_input/panel_metadata.csv \
    --mCS_cancer_type bladder \
    --chrom_sizes_file hg38_no_alt.chrom_sizes \
    -profile slurm,singularity \
    -resume
```

Expected runtime: < 5 min  

#### Output

| Title | File path | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Targets with buffered regions | `minknow_input/<project_name>.targets_buffed.bed` | bed file for adaptive sampling |
| Targets for alignment stats | `minknow_input/<project_name>.targets_for_align.bed` | A bed file provided for optional alignment of your target regions during sequencing. This file does NOT have buffered regions, do not use it in the adaptive sampling input. You may use it in the alignment only section, and it can help monitor read depth in your desired regions. If you are not confident with this do NOT use it. This file is also used for analysis during sample processing. |

### Outputs for clin_trial and clinical modes

Raw results for epi2melabs wf-human-variation, SNV, methylation and immune infiltrate sections can be found in their respective directories.  
In `clin_trial_mode` the outputs from these sections (excluding wf-human-variation) are collated into one csv that can be used as input to a machine learning classifier.  
In `clinical_mode` they are processed into a pdf report that uses `resources/template.md` to make.  

#### Output directory `<sample name>/wf-humvar-run`

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that on `-resume`, Nextflow checks if `<project_name>/<sample>/.nextflow_cache/wf-humvar` exists. If it does, the whole process is skipped, regardless of the task hash. This is to prevent unnecessary rerunning of this particular computationally heavy task. If you change `--bed`, `--bam`, etc., the cached wf-humvar directory will still be used. If you need to rerun the wf-human-variation part of the workflow, we recommend you manually delete the entire `<sample_name>` directory to enable a clean restart. If you are familiar with Nextflow and feel confident, you can `cd` into the correct directory and set this workflow to `-resume` independent of Panorama if you wish.

## 🎯 Biomarker panel input

This is a csv file containing metadata for each biomarker.  
This can be generated using the template excel file provided in [demo_input](demo_input/panel_metadata_template.xlsx), then "Save As" a csv. Ensure the ID column remains 3 digits long (it can be string/character format, not number).  
An example of the csv can be found here: [demo_input/panel_metadata.csv](demo_input/panel_metadata.csv)  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - ID numbers in the 300's are reserved for molecular characterists comprised of multiple individual biomarkers/features, such as TNBC, HR+, subtypes, etc. These are not directly measured by sequencing but are calculated from multiple biomarker results.
> - ID numbers in the 400's are reserved for immune parameters
> - ID numbers in the 500's are reserved for additional non-molecular factors such as demographic or clinicopathologic indicators that you wish to include in the classifiers but cannot be measured by nanopore sequencing
> - The biomarker types "immune_inf" must not be changed

## 🤖 AI Assistance

Development of this project used AI-assisted coding tools:

- GitHub Copilot (VS Code extension)
- Claude Sonnet v4.x
- GPT-5 mini
- Prompt layering tool: @Sequera

AI was used for language refactoring from Snakemake to Nextflow, and implementing industry-standard conventions. It was also used for wiring of Nextflow components and debugging.  
AI tools were used interactively. Outputs were evaluated, edited, and validated by the author/s. No code was directly incorporated without review.
